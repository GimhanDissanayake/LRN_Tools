* We call code that is easy to work with "clean code".
* Object oriented programming and other paradigms like functional programming are all about making code easier to work with and understand. 

Clean code is NOT:
1. A way to make your programs run faster
2. A way to make your program use less memory
3. Necessary to create certain kinds of programs
4. Strictly better than non-OOP code

Clean code is:
1. Designed to make code easier to work with in many situations
2. Something that helps humans model and simulate the real world
3. A way to make finding and fixing bugs easier
4. A way to make new feature development faster
5. The best way to stay sane as a software engineer

* A couple of examples of "clean code" practices include writing good comments, using DRY code, and naming variables well, just to name a few.
